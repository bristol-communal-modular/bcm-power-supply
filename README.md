# BCM Power Supply

A basic eurorack power supply that can provide +12v, -12v, and +5v, at up to 1 Amp on each.

There are three PCBs here :-

* A power supply, that takes +15 volts and outputs +12v, -12v and +5v onto two eurorack power connectors
* A front panel that a DC jack and power indicator board can be mounted on
* A power indicator board that has LEDs for the three voltage rails

The power board is designed with four M3 holes in the corners, so it can be mounted into a case using stand-offs.
